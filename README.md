# Who we are

Our mission is make the University of Waterloo the best university for data science (DS). 
We invite industry speakers to discuss the problems they work on, teach our members 
the technical skills to solve problems, and organize events to apply our skills and 
learn from each other.

Currently our Fall objects revolve around mentoring students to write out interesting 
analyses on public data and to develop a team to compete on Kaggle under  the 
University of Waterloo. 

## Industry

Along with sponsor talks and career events. We are interested in developing more 
relationships and eventually raise funding for a Data/ML Hackathon. Where students
take public or private datasets (provided by companies) and showcase our analysis 
and machine learning skills.

# What does success look like?

1. Hosting weekly meetings that bring students together to build a strong network of aspirign data scientists.
2. Collaborating with industry to develop a sustainable workshop series for students to teach them the desired skills.
3. Inviting +3 companies each term to speak about their data science work and career oppertunities.
4. Developing relationships with 2 professors who can help the club grow along side the new degree offerings.
